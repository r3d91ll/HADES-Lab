# GraphSAGE Directory Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-01-11

## Actions Taken

### 1. Moved to Acheron (with timestamps)

#### Training Scripts
- `train_fast.py` → Acheron/graphsage/training/
- `train_simple.py` → Acheron/graphsage/training/
- `train_ultra.py` → Acheron/graphsage/training/
- `train_enhanced.py` → Acheron/graphsage/training/
- `gnn_trainer.py` → Acheron/graphsage/training/

#### Graph Building Scripts
- `build_graph_optimized.py` → Acheron/graphsage/graph_building/
- `build_coauthorship_correct.py` → Acheron/graphsage/utils/
- `build_academic_graph.py` → Acheron/graphsage/utils/
- `rebuild_graph_clean.py` → Acheron/graphsage/utils/
- `build_metadata_graph.py` → Acheron/graphsage/utils/
- `analyze_author_ambiguity.py` → Acheron/graphsage/utils/

### 2. Moved Large Data Files

- `pipelines/cache/graph_cache.json` (185MB) → `/data/graphsage/cache/`
- `utils/clean_graph.json` (50MB) → `/data/graphsage/exports/`
- `utils/paper_centric_graph.json` (1.4GB) → `/data/graphsage/exports/`

### 3. Reorganized Directory Structure

```

### 4. Created Documentation

- **README.md**: Comprehensive module documentation including:
  - Death of the Author philosophy
  - Architecture overview
  - Current graph statistics (31.7M edges and growing)
  - Performance metrics and optimizations
  - Thermal management discoveries
  - Conveyance framework analysis

## Current Graph Building Status

- **Runtime**: 20+ hours (started 2025-01-10 ~15:33)
- **Edges Created**:
  - `same_field`: 25,706,082 edges ✓
  - `temporal_proximity`: 5,987,388 edges ✓
  - `keyword_similarity`: In progress...
  - `citations`: Pending
- **Total So Far**: 31,693,470 edges
- **Papers**: 2,824,688
- **Average Degree**: ~22.4 (much higher than expected!)

## Key Improvements

1. **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns (monitoring, training, utils)
2. **Preservation**: All deprecated code preserved in Acheron with timestamps
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with philosophy, architecture, and metrics
4. **Data Management**: Large files moved to dedicated data directory
5. **Clean Structure**: Logical grouping makes navigation intuitive

## Next Steps

1. Wait for keyword similarity edges to complete
2. Build citation edges (final edge type)
3. Extract features from complete graph
4. Train GraphSAGE on full 2.82M paper graph
5. Document results for "Death of the Author" paper

## Notes

- The unexpectedly high edge count (25.7M for same_field) suggests papers have many category connections
- Thermal management remains crucial - maintaining 80-85°C with side panel removed
- Graph building showing excellent parallelization with 36 workers
