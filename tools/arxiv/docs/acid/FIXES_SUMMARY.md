# ACID Pipeline Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-08-24

### Issues Fixed

1. **Jina Model Loading Issue** ✅
   - **Problem**: Model was loading once per document instead of once per worker
   - **Fix**: Moved model initialization to worker-level using global variables
   - **Result**: Massive performance improvement, proper GPU memory usage

2. **Batch Size Not Being Used** ✅
   - **Problem**: Configuration batch_size parameter wasn't being used at all
   - **Fix**: Initially tried to implement batching, but ultimately removed it entirely
   - **Solution**: Used ProcessPoolExecutor's natural work-stealing queue
   - **Result**: Simple, efficient work distribution among all workers

3. **Worker Underutilization** ✅
   - **Problem**: With batching, only 5 batches for 36 workers = 31 idle workers
   - **Fix**: Removed batching, let each worker pull tasks individually
   - **Result**: All workers stay busy, achieving 6 papers/minute extraction rate

4. **Phase Transition Issues** ✅
   - **Problem**: Docling workers didn't unload from GPU before embedding phase
   - **Fix**: Added 5-second delay between phases for proper cleanup
   - **Result**: Clean transition between extraction and embedding phases

5. **JSON Structure Mismatch** ✅
   - **Problem**: Embedding function looked for `doc['extracted']` which didn't exist
   - **Reality**: Staged JSONs have `full_text` and `markdown` at top level
   - **Fix**: Changed to `doc.get('full_text', '') or doc.get('markdown', '')`
   - **Also Fixed**: Structures are in `doc['structures']` not `doc['extracted']`
   - **Result**: Embedding phase can now process staged files correctly

### Performance Achieved

- **Extraction Phase**: ~6 papers/minute (exceeding 2-3 target!)
- **CPU Utilization**: Near 100% during extraction (expected for Docling)
- **GPU Usage**: Efficient use for specific Docling tasks
- **Worker Distribution**: All workers active (no idle workers)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **No Batching**: Simple work queue is better than complex batching logic
2. **Phase Separation**: Complete extraction before starting embedding
3. **Worker-Level Models**: Load models once per worker, not per document
4. **RamFS Staging**: Use `/dev/shm/acid_staging` for fast intermediate storage

### How to Run

```bash
# With fixed code
./run_pipeline_fixed.sh

# Or manually
python acid_pipeline_phased.py \
    --config configs/acid_pipeline_phased.yaml \
    --max-papers 100 \
    --pg-password "$PGPASSWORD" \
    --arango-password "$ARANGO_PASSWORD"
```

### Files Modified

1. `/home/todd/olympus/HADES/tools/arxiv/acid/acid_pipeline_phased.py`
   - Removed batching logic
   - Fixed JSON structure access
   - Added phase transition delays
   - Fixed static method declaration

2. `/home/todd/olympus/HADES/tools/arxiv/acid/configs/acid_pipeline_phased.yaml`
   - Increased workers to 36
   - Increased batch_size to 24 (though not used anymore)

### Testing

Run `python test_embedding_fixed.py` to verify:
- Staged JSON structure is correct
- Text extraction works properly
- Structures are accessible

### Next Steps

1. Run full pipeline test with fixed embedding
2. Monitor GPU memory during embedding phase
3. Verify atomic transactions in ArangoDB
4. Scale up to larger batches once confirmed working
