# Git Changes Summary for ACID Pipeline

## Major Achievements

### Performance Breakthrough
- Achieved **5.9 papers/minute** (2-3x target performance)
- 100% success rate on 100 paper test
- Successfully implemented E3 architecture (Extract → Encode → Embed)

### Key Fixes Implemented

1. **Worker-Level Model Loading**
   - Fixed: Jina model was loading once per document (causing massive overhead)
   - Solution: Load models once per worker using global WORKER_EMBEDDER

2. **Batch Size Implementation**
   - Fixed: batch_size parameter wasn't being used
   - Solution: Removed complex batching, use ProcessPoolExecutor's natural queue

3. **Phase Separation**
   - Fixed: Docling workers weren't unloading from GPU between phases
   - Solution: Added 5-second delay and GPU cleanup between extraction and embedding

4. **JSON Structure Mismatch**
   - Fixed: Embedding phase expected different JSON structure
   - Solution: Updated to use correct structure (full_text at top level)

5. **Worker Utilization**
   - Fixed: Only 5 batches for 36 workers = 31 idle workers
   - Solution: Each worker pulls individual tasks from queue

## Suggested Commit Structure

### Commit 1: Core Pipeline Implementation
```
feat(acid): Implement E3 architecture with phase-separated processing

- Add acid_pipeline_phased.py with Extract-Encode-Embed pattern
- Implement worker-level model loading for efficiency
- Add phase separation with GPU cleanup between stages
- Configure 36 extraction workers, 8 embedding workers
```

### Commit 2: Configuration and Scripts
```
feat(acid): Add production configuration and run scripts

- Add acid_pipeline_phased.yaml with optimized settings
- Add run_phased_pipeline.sh for production execution
- Configure batch_size=24 for Jina v4 embeddings
- Set up /dev/shm/acid_staging for RamFS performance
```

### Commit 3: Documentation
```
docs(acid): Document E3 architecture and performance achievements

- Add E3_ARCHITECTURE.md explaining the pattern
- Add PERFORMANCE_MILESTONE.md with 5.9 papers/min achievement
- Add FIXES_SUMMARY.md documenting all bug fixes
- Update README.md with production usage instructions
```

### Commit 4: Archive and Cleanup
```
chore(acid): Archive one-time scripts and organize directory

- Move test scripts to archive/test_scripts/
- Move old pipeline versions to archive/old_pipelines/
- Move monitoring scripts to archive/monitoring/
- Keep production and test infrastructure files
```

## Merge Strategy

When merging ACID_compliant branch to main:
- **Conflict Resolution**: Always favor ACID_compliant branch changes
- **Reason**: This branch contains the working, optimized pipeline
- **Testing**: 1000 paper test validates production readiness
