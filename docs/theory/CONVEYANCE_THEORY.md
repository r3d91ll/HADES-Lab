# Conveyance Theory: The Potentiality of Information Transformation

**Date:** 2025-01-22  
**Status:** Working Paper (v2.0 - Addressing Reviewer Feedback)  
**Authors:** Todd & Claude  
**Purpose:** Defining conveyance as transformation potential in Information Reconstructionism

## Abstract

While our framework has consistently used conveyance (C) as the central metric for information flow, we have not rigorously defined what conveyance actually represents. This document establishes conveyance as the **expected value of data transformation through observer interaction**—combining the probability that interaction produces transformation with the value of that transformation. We show how conveyance follows an inverted-U relationship with context (the **context entropy curve**), where too little context yields random behavior while too much causes decision paralysis. We formalize the mapping between our probabilistic definition and the efficiency view C = (W·R·H)/T · Ctx^α, ensuring α applies only to context amplification, not internal probabilities.

## 1. Reframing Information as Process

### 1.1 Information is Not a Thing

Traditional information theory treats information as a quantity—bits, entropy, messages. But this misses the fundamental nature of information:

**Information is data being transformed by an observer.**

More precisely:
- **Data** = Raw patterns existing in the world
- **Observer** = Any entity capable of transformation
- **Information** = The process of data transformation within observer frames
- **Knowledge** = The persistent internal changes resulting from information

### 1.2 The Transformation Process

When data appears within an observer's frame of reference:

1. **Detection**: Data crosses the observer's boundary
2. **Processing**: Observer applies internal transformations
3. **Integration**: Results placed within observer's internal map
4. **Modification**: Internal data changes or creates new patterns
5. **Potential Action**: May trigger external data creation

Each interaction changes the observer's state, and potentially creates new data objects in the network.

### 1.3 Observer as Active Participant

The observer is not passive—it actively transforms:
- External data → Internal representations
- Internal patterns → External artifacts
- Existing connections → New relationships

**Key Insight**: Information doesn't exist "in" the data or "in" the observer—it IS the transformation process between them.

## 2. Defining Conveyance

### 2.1 Conveyance as Expected Value

**Conveyance (C)** = The expected value of transformation from an interaction

More formally:
```math
C = P(Transformation | Interaction) × Value(Transformation) × Ctx^α
```

Where:
- **P(Transformation | Interaction)** = Probability that interaction produces change (monotone in W,R,H; inverse in T)
- **Value(Transformation)** = Bounded utility ∈ [0,1] derived from actionability and grounding
- **Ctx^α** = Context amplification (α applied ONLY here, not in probability calculation)

**Alignment to Efficiency View**: We instantiate C = (W·R·H)/T · Ctx^α. Here P(Transformation|Interaction) is a calibrated, monotone function of {W,R,H} and T; Value(Transformation) is a bounded utility V ∈ [0,1]. Amplification enters only via Ctx^α, where α denotes ONLY the context amplification exponent; other exponents (distance, decay) use different symbols (η_dist, τ_half).

### 2.2 The Context Entropy Curve

Context doesn't monotonically improve conveyance—it follows an **inverted-U relationship**:

```math
Effective_Context(Ctx_raw) = Ctx_raw × exp(-λ × |Ctx_raw - Ctx_optimal|²)
```

**Three Regimes:**

1. **Low Context (High Entropy)**
   - Too many equally probable options
   - Observer cannot distinguish meaningful paths
   - Essentially random selection
   - C → 0 as choices become arbitrary

2. **Optimal Context (Sweet Spot)**  
   - Entropy reduced to manageable option set
   - Clear but not overdetermined paths
   - Maximum transformation potential
   - C = maximum at Ctx_optimal

3. **Context Flooding (Over-constraint)**
   - Options reduced to binary: do nothing or single action
   - No creative transformation possible
   - Decision paralysis in complex observers
   - C → 0 as flexibility vanishes

**The Genius Paradox**: High-capability observers (large H) process more context dimensions, making them vulnerable to context flooding where others see optimal context. They perceive variables others don't even know exist, leading to paralysis.

### 2.3 Formal Probability Model

Following reviewer feedback, we formalize P(Transformation) as a calibrated logistic:

```math
P(Transform_{i→j}) = σ(θ₀ + θ_W log W_{ij} + θ_R log R_{ij} + θ_H log H_{ij} + θ_C log Ctx* - θ_T log(1 + T_{ij}))
```

Where:
- σ is the sigmoid function
- θ parameters are calibrated on observed transformations
- Ctx* is sigmoid-transformed context ∈ [0,1] (NOT raised to α here)
- T_{ij} is compute time in milliseconds (NOT measurement time)
- Zero-propagation: if any {W,R,H} = 0 or T → ∞, then P → 0
- Grace bands (0.10, 0.05) warn before collapse; multimodal/logit layers cannot resurrect zeros

### 2.4 Value Decomposition

The Value component is bounded and auditable:

```math
V ∈ [0,1] where V = w_A·A + w_G·G + w_I·I + w_L·L
```

With weights normalized: Σw_i = 1

- **A** (Actionability): Can it be implemented?
- **G** (Grounding): Is it connected to reality?
- **I** (Instruction fit): Does it match the task?
- **L** (Local coherence): Is it internally consistent?

**Critical**: No amplification in V—amplification enters ONLY via Ctx^α

### 2.5 Types of Transformation

Conveyance manifests through different transformation types:

**Internal Transformations** (Observer's knowledge state):
- Conceptual understanding
- Pattern recognition
- Mental model updates
- Skill acquisition

**External Transformations** (Network artifacts):
- Code implementations
- Documentation
- New connections
- Derived works

**Hybrid Transformations** (Both internal and external):
- Learning + creating
- Understanding + implementing
- Reading + annotating
- Analyzing + reporting

### 2.6 The Conveyance Spectrum

Not all interactions have equal conveyance. These thresholds are **illustrative** and **empirically calibrated per domain**:

**Zero Conveyance** (C = 0):
- Encrypted data (no transformation possible)
- Redundant information (no new transformation)
- Incompatible formats (transformation blocked)

**Low Conveyance** (C ≈ 0.1-0.3):
- Abstract philosophy (minimal actionable transformation)
- Raw data dumps (limited interpretability)
- Isolated facts (no connective potential)

**Medium Conveyance** (C ≈ 0.4-0.7):
- Tutorials (structured transformation paths)
- Academic papers (conceptual transformations)
- API documentation (implementation guidance)

**High Conveyance** (C ≈ 0.8-1.0):
- Theory with implementation (complete transformation bridge)
- Worked examples (transformation templates)
- Interactive notebooks (immediate transformation feedback)

## 3. Theory-Practice Bridges as High Conveyance

### 3.1 Why Bridges Maximize Conveyance

Theory-practice bridges represent maximum conveyance because they enable both:
- **Conceptual transformation** (understanding the theory)
- **Practical transformation** (implementing the practice)

The bridge creates a **transformation pathway** that observers can follow from abstract to concrete.

### 3.2 Identifying Bridge Patterns

High-conveyance bridges exhibit specific patterns:

**Semantic Markers**:
- "Algorithm" → "Implementation"
- "Theorem" → "Proof" → "Code"
- "Architecture" → "System"
- "Method" → "Results"

**Structural Markers**:
- Paper citations in code comments
- Equation references in function names
- Theory sections followed by experiment code
- Abstract concepts with concrete examples

**Relational Markers**:
- Shared authors between paper and repository
- Temporal proximity (code released near paper date)
- Explicit references (README citing paper)
- Common terminology across artifacts

### 3.3 The Transformation Chain

Theory-practice bridges create transformation chains:

```
Theory Paper → Reader's Understanding → Implementation Attempt → Working Code → New Applications
```

Each arrow represents a transformation with measurable conveyance. The complete chain has multiplicative **enablement**—a zero at any step collapses downstream C.

## 4. Generalizable Semantic Markers

### 4.1 Universal Transformation Indicators

Certain patterns indicate high transformation potential across domains. These markers primarily inform **P(Transform)** unless they measure outcomes:

**Actionability Markers** (inform P):
- Imperative verbs: "implement", "apply", "use", "create"
- Process descriptions: "step", "phase", "procedure", "method"
- Causal language: "therefore", "results in", "produces", "generates"

**Bridging Markers** (inform P):
- Translation terms: "in practice", "concretely", "for example", "specifically"
- Comparison structures: "in theory... in practice", "abstract... concrete"
- Implementation signals: "code", "algorithm", "pseudocode", "function"

**Completeness Markers** (inform P):
- Input/output specifications
- Prerequisites listed
- Success criteria defined
- Error conditions described

**Outcome Measures** (inform V):
- Tests passed/total
- Specification coverage
- Human quality rubrics
- Downstream adoption rates

### 4.2 Graph Database Patterns

In a graph database, high-conveyance nodes exhibit:

**Structural Properties**:
- High betweenness centrality (bridge position)
- Multiple edge types (diverse connections)
- Bidirectional relationships (two-way transformation)
- Cluster bridging (connects communities)

**Semantic Properties**:
- Multi-modal content (text + code + data)
- Progressive complexity (simple → complex)
- Explicit dependencies (clear prerequisites)
- Measurable outcomes (testable results)

**Temporal Properties**:
- Version evolution (iterative refinement)
- Update frequency (active transformation)
- Response patterns (Q&A, issues, fixes)
- Adoption curves (spreading transformation)

### 4.3 Conveyance Computation in Graphs

For any edge (i,j) in our graph:

```python
def score_probability(node_i, node_j, edge_properties, t_compute_ms):
    """Compute P(Transform) with proper gates and bounds."""
    
    # --- W: semantic alignment (0..1) ---
    w_sem = max(0.0, min(1.0, cosine_similarity(node_i.embedding, node_j.embedding)))

    # --- R: structural positioning with gates ---
    d = shortest_path_length_or_none(node_i, node_j)  # -> int or None
    if d is None:
        r_gate = 0.0  # no path => R=0 => C=0
    else:
        eta_dist = edge_properties.get("eta_dist", 2.0)  # learned distance exponent
        r_distance = (1.0 + d) ** (-eta_dist)

        # learned boundary permeability in (0..1]
        b_feats = extract_boundary_features(node_i, node_j)
        r_boundary = sigmoid(boundary_model.dot(b_feats))  # bootstrap: 0.6^b

        # multiplicative gate
        r_gate = r_distance * r_boundary

    # --- H: agency compatibility (0..1) ---
    h_format = check_format_compatibility(node_i, node_j)        # 0..1
    h_tools  = check_transformation_tools(node_i.type, node_j.type)  # 0..1
    h_score  = h_format * h_tools

    # --- Context features for the logit only (not α here) ---
    l = local_coherence(node_i, node_j)
    i = instruction_fit(edge_properties)
    a = actionability(node_i, node_j)
    g = grounding(node_j.external_references)
    ctx_star = 0.5 * (1 + np.tanh(5.0 * ((0.25*l + 0.25*i + 0.25*a + 0.25*g) - 0.5)))  # 0..1

    # --- Probability of transformation (calibrated logistic) ---
    eps = 1e-6
    x = (
        theta0
        + thetaW * np.log(w_sem + eps)
        + thetaR * np.log(r_gate + eps)
        + thetaH * np.log(h_score + eps)
        + thetaC * np.log(ctx_star + eps)
        - thetaT * np.log(1.0 + t_compute_ms)
    )
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-x))  # P in [0,1]

def score_value(node_i, node_j):
    """Compute V(Transform) - bounded value with no amplification."""
    
    # Value components (no amplification here)
    A = estimate_actionability(node_i, node_j)
    G = estimate_grounding(node_j)
    L = estimate_local_coherence(node_i, node_j)
    I = estimate_instruction_fit(node_i, node_j)
    
    # Weighted combination (weights sum to 1)
    V = 0.35*A + 0.35*G + 0.15*L + 0.15*I
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, V))

def compute_conveyance(node_i, node_j, edge_properties, t_compute_ms, ctx_raw):
    """Compute C = P × V × Ctx^α with proper separation."""
    
    P = score_probability(node_i, node_j, edge_properties, t_compute_ms)
    V = score_value(node_i, node_j)
    
    # Apply context entropy curve
    ctx_optimal = edge_properties.get("ctx_optimal", 0.7)
    distance = abs(ctx_raw - ctx_optimal)
    ctx_effective = ctx_raw * np.exp(-2.0 * distance**2)
    
    # Single place where α is used
    alpha_ctx = edge_properties.get("alpha_ctx", 1.7)  # calibrated per domain
    
    return P * V * (ctx_effective ** alpha_ctx)
```

## 5. Transformation Networks

### 5.1 Expected Transformation Yield (ETY)

Following reviewer guidance, we formalize propagation through Expected Transformation Yield:

```math
ETY(s; H) = Σ_{h=1}^H Σ_{p∈P_h(s)} [∏_{(u→v)∈p} P_{u→v}] × V_p × δ^h
```

Where:
- H = horizon (steps into future)
- P_h(s) = paths of length h from source s
- P_{u→v} = transformation probability for edge
- V_p = path value (geometric mean of edge values)
- δ ∈ (0,1) = temporal discount factor

**Conveyance Centrality**: Nodes ranked by ETY become "ETY hubs" (replacing vague "conveyance hubs")

### 5.2 Observer-Specific Models

Different observer classes have different transformation parameters:

```python
class ObserverModel:
    def __init__(self, observer_class):
        # Observer-specific parameters
        if observer_class == "human":
            self.θ_T = 0.2  # Humans tolerate higher latency
            self.context_optimal = 0.7  # Moderate context preferred
            self.paralysis_threshold = 0.9
        elif observer_class == "llm":
            self.θ_T = 0.5  # LLMs sensitive to token limits
            self.context_optimal = 0.8  # Can handle more context
            self.paralysis_threshold = 0.95
        elif observer_class == "agent":
            self.θ_T = 0.8  # Agents need fast responses
            self.context_optimal = 0.6  # Prefer clear directives
            self.paralysis_threshold = 0.85
    
    def compute_effective_context(self, ctx_raw):
        # Apply inverted-U curve with observer-specific optimum
        distance = abs(ctx_raw - self.context_optimal)
        return ctx_raw * exp(-2.0 * distance**2)
```

### 5.3 Conveyance Decay

Conveyance naturally decays with:
- **Distance**: Each hop reduces transformation fidelity
- **Time**: Information becomes stale, contexts change
- **Boundaries**: System crossings impose translation costs
- **Noise**: Each transformation introduces errors

Decay function:
```math
C(d,t,b) = C_0 · (1+d)^(-η_dist) · exp(-t/τ_half) · π_boundary(b)
```

Where:
- d = graph distance
- t = temporal distance
- b = boundary crossings
- η_dist = learned distance exponent (NOT α, which is reserved for context)
- τ_half = learned relevance half-life
- π_boundary(b) = learned permeability across b boundaries (logistic or calibrated table)
- Bootstrap default: π_boundary(b) = 0.6^b (only if learned model unavailable)

### 5.4 Conveyance Optimization

To maximize network conveyance:

**Structural Strategies**:
- Position bridges at high-traffic paths
- Minimize boundary crossings
- Create redundant transformation paths
- Cluster related transformations

**Semantic Strategies**:
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Provide progressive complexity
- Include concrete examples
- Link abstract to concrete

**Temporal Strategies**:
- Update stale connections
- Version transformations explicitly
- Track transformation lineage
- Preserve transformation history

## 6. Measuring Conveyance Empirically

### 6.1 Time Budget Protection

Critical for maintaining system performance:

```python
class TimeBudget:
    def __init__(self):
        self.T_compute_budget = 0.95  # 95% for actual computation
        self.T_measure_budget = 0.05  # 5% max for measurement
        
    def track_time(self, operation, time_ms):
        if operation == "measure":
            if time_ms > self.T_measure_budget * self.total_time:
                # Sample or cache heavy features
                return self.use_cached_value()
        return time_ms
```

**Rule**: T_measure ≤ 5% of p95 makespan; heavy features (graph paths, NLI) sampled 1-in-N

### 6.2 Direct Measurements

**Transformation Counting**:
- Count actual implementations from papers
- Track code citations to theory
- Measure student comprehension improvements
- Monitor artifact creation rates

**Success Metrics**:
- Implementation success rate
- Time-to-implementation (median & p95) - ties back to T
- Error rates in transformation
- Adoption/diffusion speed
- AUROC > 0.80 for bridge detection
- ECE < 0.05 (well-calibrated probabilities)

### 6.2 Indirect Indicators

**Engagement Metrics**:
- View/download ratios
- Fork/star patterns
- Issue discussions
- Q&A frequency

**Network Metrics**:
- Clustering coefficients around bridges
- Information flow bottlenecks
- Cascade sizes from seeds
- Component connectivity

### 6.3 Validation Experiments

**Experiment 1: Theory-Practice Detection**
```python
def validate_bridge_detection():
    """
    Test if semantic markers identify real bridges.
    """
    known_bridges = load_validated_paper_code_pairs()
    
    for paper, code in known_bridges:
        predicted_conveyance = compute_conveyance(paper, code)
        actual_implementations = count_implementations(paper)
        
        correlation = pearson_correlation(
            predicted_conveyance, 
            actual_implementations
        )
    
    return correlation  # Expect > 0.7
```

**Experiment 2: Conveyance Propagation**
```python
def test_propagation():
    """
    Verify conveyance cascades through network.
    """
    high_conveyance_seed = select_known_influential_paper()
    
    # Measure transformation cascade
    generation_1 = direct_implementations(seed)
    generation_2 = implementations_of(generation_1)
    generation_3 = implementations_of(generation_2)
    
    # Conveyance should decay but remain non-zero
    assert conveyance(generation_1) > conveyance(generation_2)
    assert conveyance(generation_2) > conveyance(generation_3)
    assert conveyance(generation_3) > 0
```

## 7. Implications for System Design

### 7.1 Database Design for Conveyance

Structure databases to facilitate transformation:

```sql
-- Enhanced transformation potential table
CREATE TABLE conveyance_scores (
    source_id VARCHAR(255),
    target_id VARCHAR(255),
    transformation_type VARCHAR(50),

    PRIMARY KEY (node_id, marker_type)
);

-- Context ledger for avoiding double-counting
CREATE TABLE context_ledger (
    feature_name VARCHAR(100),

    counted_in VARCHAR(20),   -- 'intrinsic' or 'amplification'
    PRIMARY KEY (feature_name)
);
```

### 7.2 API Design for Transformation

Design APIs that maximize conveyance:

```python
class TransformationAPI:
    def find_bridges(self, source_type, target_type):
        """Find high-conveyance paths between types."""
        
    def measure_conveyance(self, source, target, observer, t_compute_ms):
        """Return P, V, C, diagnostics, and budgets used."""
        p = self.score_probability(source, target, observer, t_compute_ms)
        v = self.score_value(source, target)
        ctx = self.get_context(source, target, observer)
        c = p * v * (ctx ** self.alpha_ctx)
        return {
            "probability": p,
            "value": v, 
            "context": ctx,
            "conveyance": c,
            "t_compute": t_compute_ms,
            "t_measure": self.measure_time_ms
        }
        
    def track_transformation(self, source, target, result, value_obs):
        """Log realized transform; updates calibration."""
        
    def rank_hubs(self, horizon=3):
        """ETY-based conveyance centrality over horizon."""
        
    def suggest_transformations(self, node):
        """Recommend high-conveyance next steps."""
```

### 7.3 Interface Design for Conveyance

## 9. Conclusion

Conveyance is not merely a metric but the fundamental measure of information's transformative potential. By defining conveyance as the expected value of data transformation through observer interaction, we can:

1. **Identify** high-value connections in knowledge graphs via ETY ranking
2. **Predict** where transformations are likely to occur using calibrated probabilities
3. **Optimize** systems for the context sweet spot, avoiding both randomness and paralysis
4. **Measure** the actual impact of information artifacts with bounded, auditable values

The critical insight is that context follows an **inverted-U curve**: too little context leaves observers in high-entropy chaos, while too much causes decision paralysis. Optimal conveyance occurs at the sweet spot where context reduces options to a manageable but not overdetermined set.

Theory-practice bridges represent conveyance maximization because they enable complete transformation chains from abstract understanding to concrete implementation. The semantic markers we've identified—actionability indicators, bridging terms, completeness signals—serve as predictors of transformation probability, not value.

## 10. Reviewer Questions

Based on Reviewer #2's feedback, we pose these clarifying questions:

1. **Foundational equivalence**: "Do you agree that our probability–value definition is equivalent (up to calibration) to the efficiency view C = (W·R·H)/T·Ctx^α, provided amplification is confined to Ctx^α?"

2. **Observer specificity**: "Shall we report C stratified by observer class (human/LLM/agent), with shared θ where transfer holds?"

3. **Value policy**: "If V is unobserved, we set V = domain prior and surface value_coverage. Acceptable?"

4. **T budgeting**: "Target guardrail: T_measure ≤ 5% of p95 makespan; heavy features sampled. OK?"

5. **Context entropy**: "Should we model the context optimum as observer-specific (humans: 0.7, LLMs: 0.8, agents: 0.6) or learn from data?"

As we build systems based on Information Reconstructionism, conveyance becomes our north star metric: not just moving data, but maximizing the potential for meaningful transformation at every interaction, while carefully managing the context to hit the sweet spot between chaos and paralysis.
