**Date:** 2025-01-22  
**Status:** Summary Document (v1.0)  
**Authors:** Todd & Claude  
**Purpose:** Introduction and synthesis of the four-dimensional framework

## Executive Summary

Information Reconstructionism presents a revolutionary framework where information exists only through the multiplicative interaction of semantic quality (WHAT), relational positioning (WHERE), and agency (WHO), measured as a rate over time. The fundamental equation **C = (W×R×H)/T × Ctx^α** captures how information flows through systems, with context providing super-linear amplification. This document synthesizes insights from four foundational papers to provide a unified theory of information existence and transformation.

## The Core Insight

Information is not a static property but a dynamic phenomenon that emerges only when:
1. **Quality content exists** (W > 0)
2. **In accessible positions** (R > 0)  
3. **With capable agents** (H > 0)
4. **Within finite time** (T < ∞)
5. **Amplified by context** (Ctx^α where α ∈ [1.5, 2.0])

If any essential dimension equals zero, information cannot exist—this is the **zero-propagation axiom** that underlies all our work.

## The Fundamental Equation

### Primary Form (Efficiency View)
```
C = (W × R × H) / T × Ctx^α
```

Where:
- **C** = Conveyance (information flow rate)
- **W** = WHAT (semantic quality, 0-1)
- **R** = WHERE (relational position, 0-1)
- **H** = WHO (agency capability, 0-1)
- **T** = Time (observed duration)
- **Ctx** = Context quality (0-1)
- **α** = Amplification exponent (1.5-2.0)

### Why Time is Different

Time is not a fourth dimension but the **fundamental divisor** that transforms capacity into flow:
- Spatial dimensions compress into R (WHERE)
- Semantic dimensions compress into W (WHAT)
- Agency dimensions compress into H (WHO)
- Time remains the universal measure of change

This mirrors physical laws: velocity = distance/time, not distance × time.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. WHAT: Semantic Quality and Information Density

**Core Principle**: Information requires semantic understanding to exist.

**Key Components**:
- **Signal quality** (W_signal): Coherence and clarity
- **Information density** (W_density): Concepts per token
- **Fidelity** (W_fidelity): Preservation through transformation
- **Authenticity** (W_authenticity): Factual grounding

**Temporal Dependency**: W(T) = W_max × (1 - exp(-T/τ_W))
- Minimum time: ~150ms for basic semantic processing
- Phase transitions at critical density thresholds
- Multi-modal synergy when coherent (W_total > ΣW_i)

**Zero Cases**: 
- Encrypted files (W = 0)
- Corrupted data (W = 0)
- Unknown formats (W = 0)

### 2. WHERE: Topological Positioning and Accessibility

**Core Principle**: Information must be reachable to exist.

**Key Components**:
- **Proximity** (R_proximity): Path distance in networks
- **Accessibility** (R_accessibility): Boundary permeability
- **Connectivity** (R_connectivity): Number of paths
- **Centrality** (R_centrality): Hub effects

**Temporal Dependency**: R(T) = R_max × (1 - exp(-T/τ_R))
- Minimum time: 2-15ms per graph hop
- Power-law decay with distance: A(d) ∝ d^(-α)
- Exponential penalty for boundary crossings

**Zero Cases**:
- Orphaned files (R = 0)
- Broken links (R = 0)
- Isolated nodes (R = 0)

### 3. WHO: Agency, Access, and Capability

**Core Principle**: Information requires an agent to observe and transform it.

**Key Components**:
- **Access** (H_access): Authorization and permissions
- **Capability** (H_capability): Processing sophistication
- **Tools** (H_tools): Available operations
- **Context utilization** (H_context): Coherence maintenance

**MCP Duality**: The MCP endpoint serves as both:
- **Gatekeeper** (from outside): Limiting external agency
- **Agent** (from inside): Operating within the system

**Temporal Dependency**: H(T) = H_max × (1 - exp(-T/τ_H))
- Minimum time: 230-2300ms for agent operations
- Tool execution latency
- Context processing overhead

**Zero Cases**:
- No permissions (H = 0)
- Insufficient capability (H = 0)
- No tools available (H = 0)

### 4. TIME: The Fundamental Divisor

**Core Principle**: Time transforms dimensional capacity into information flow.

**Key Insights**:
- **Not a dimension**: Time is the measure against which change occurs
- **Observable only**: We measure clock time within FRAMEs, not metaphysical time
- **Natural bounds**: T_min (below which dimensions vanish) and T_max (beyond which information stales)

**The T→0 Paradox Resolution**:
- Naive view: C→∞ as T→0
- Reality: W(T)→0, R(T)→0, H(T)→0 as T→0
- Result: 0/0 indeterminate, not infinite

**Makespan for Parallel Operations**:
```python
T_parallel = max(T_operations) + T_coordination
```

## Context Amplification

Context doesn't just add to conveyance—it amplifies it super-linearly:

### Context Composition
```
Ctx = w_L×L + w_I×I + w_A×A + w_G×G
```

Where:
- **L** = Local coherence (document structure preservation)
- **I** = Instruction fit (task alignment)
- **A** = Actionability (implementation clarity)
- **G** = Grounding (real-world connections)

### Amplification Effect
The exponent α varies by domain:
- Technical documentation: α ≈ 1.5
- Creative/literary: α ≈ 2.0
- Code with examples: α ≈ 1.8

This means doubling context quality can triple or quadruple conveyance.

## Zero-Propagation: The Universal Gate

The multiplicative model ensures information cannot exist with missing prerequisites:

### Examples

**Encrypted File**:
- W = 0 (no semantic access)
- R = 1 (file exists)
- H = 1 (agent present)
- Result: 1 × 0 × 1 = 0 (no information)

**Abstract Philosophy**:
- W = 1 (understand concepts)
- R = 1 (document accessible)
- H = 1 (capable reader)
- Ctx_A = 0 (no actionability)
- Result: High W×R×H but minimal conveyance without actionable context

**Missing File**:
- W = N/A
- R = 0 (cannot locate)
- H = 1 (agent ready)
- Result: No information can flow

## Practical Implications

### System Design Principles

1. **Never optimize single dimensions**: All must be non-zero
2. **Time has hard limits**: Respect T_min for each dimension
3. **Context is multiplicative gold**: Small improvements yield large gains
4. **Boundaries matter**: Each system crossing reduces R exponentially

### Optimization Strategies

To maximize conveyance C:
- **Reduce T**: Parallelize, cache, optimize algorithms
- **Increase W**: Improve content quality, denoise, enrich
- **Increase R**: Position near hubs, create multiple paths
- **Increase H**: Better tools, more capable models
- **Amplify Ctx**: Preserve coherence, enhance actionability

### Measurement Protocol

1. **Baseline each dimension independently** (Phase 1)
2. **Measure interactions dynamically** (Phase 2)
3. **Calculate conveyance**: C = (W×R×H)/T × Ctx^α
4. **Validate zero-propagation**: Test with zeroed dimensions

## Empirical Validation

### Hypotheses to Test

**H1: Context Super-linearity**
- Measure α across domains
- Expect 1.5 ≤ α ≤ 2.0
- Higher α for creative domains

**H2: Zero-Propagation**
- Any dimension → 0 implies C → 0
- Test with encrypted files, missing data, no access

**H3: Temporal Bounds**
- Below T_min, dimensions become unobservable
- Beyond T_max, information becomes stale

**H4: Theory-Practice Bridges**
- Strong bridges maximize all dimensions
- Measure (paper, code) pairs for validation

### Expected Measurements

**Minimum Observable Times**:
- Semantic (W): ~150ms
- Relational (R): ~2-15ms  
- Agency (H): ~230-2300ms
- Combined T_min: ~400-2500ms

**Decay Patterns**:
- WHERE: Power-law d^(-α), α ∈ [1.5, 2.5]
- Boundaries: 40-70% reduction per crossing
- Context saturation: 60-80% of maximum

## Implementation Architecture

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata, maintaining R (relations)
- **ArangoDB**: Embeddings, storing W (semantic quality)
- **Collections**: Separate tables for W, R, H measurements
- **Foreign keys**: Enforce relationships (with circular reference care)

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Measure W**: Semantic extraction and embedding
2. **Calculate R**: Graph traversal and proximity
3. **Assess H**: Agent capabilities and access
4. **Track T**: Makespan of operations
5. **Compute Ctx**: Weight and combine LIAG components
6. **Calculate C**: Apply formula with empirical α

### Key Technologies
- **Jina v4**: 2048-dim embeddings with late chunking
- **Docling v2**: PDF extraction preserving structure
- **MCP Protocol**: Agent-system boundary management
- **Late Chunking**: Preserves context (L) across chunks

## Philosophical Foundations

### Observer-Dependent Reality
- Information exists only through observation
- Different observers (FRAMEs) create different realities
- The act of measurement creates the information

### Actor-Network Theory Integration
- MCP as boundary object and obligatory passage point
- Databases as actants in the network
- Translation occurs at every boundary

### Practical Epistemology
- We measure observed time, not metaphysical time
- We track behavioral patterns, not mechanistic truths
- We optimize for conveyance, not abstract understanding

## Future Directions

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement measurement infrastructure
2. Validate zero-propagation empirically
3. Measure α across different domains
4. Test temporal bound predictions

### Theoretical Extensions
1. Dynamic time allocation strategies
2. Multi-agent H composition models
3. Quantum information analogs
4. Self-optimizing sleep cycles

### Practical Applications
1. ArXiv paper-code bridge discovery
2. Automatic theory-practice matching
3. Context-aware retrieval systems
4. Conveyance-optimized databases

## Conclusion

Information Reconstructionism provides a mathematically rigorous yet philosophically grounded framework for understanding how information emerges, flows, and transforms. By recognizing that information requires the multiplicative interaction of quality (W), position (R), and agency (H), measured as a rate over time (T) and amplified by context (Ctx^α), we can design systems that optimize for actual information conveyance rather than abstract metrics.

The zero-propagation axiom ensures practical grounding—if you can't access it, understand it, or act on it, information doesn't exist for you. The temporal dependencies remind us that nothing happens instantly—every dimension needs time to manifest. And the context amplification reveals the super-linear power of coherent, actionable, grounded information.

This framework bridges computer science, information theory, and anthropology to create systems that don't just store data but actively facilitate the emergence and flow of information. As we move toward implementation, every design decision will be evaluated through this lens: **Does it improve conveyance?**

## Quick Reference

### The Equation
```
C = (W × R × H) / T × Ctx^α
