# GraphSAGE Conveyance Mathematical Analysis

## 1. GraphSAGE Mathematical Framework

### 1.1 Core Algorithm
For depth K and node v at layer k:

```
h⁰ᵥ = xᵥ, ∀v ∈ V

For k = 1...K:
    h^k_{N(v)} = AGGREGATE_k({h^{k-1}_u, ∀u ∈ N(v)})
    h^k_v = σ(W^k · CONCAT(h^{k-1}_v, h^k_{N(v)}))
    h^k_v = h^k_v / ||h^k_v||₂

z_v = h^K_v
```

### 1.2 Aggregation Functions

#### Mean Aggregator
```
AGGREGATE^mean_k = 1/|N(v)| ∑_{u∈N(v)} h^{k-1}_u
```

#### Pooling Aggregator
```
AGGREGATE^pool_k = max({σ(W_{pool}h^{k-1}_{u_i} + b), ∀u_i ∈ N(v)})
```

#### LSTM Aggregator
```
AGGREGATE^lstm_k = LSTM([h^{k-1}_{u_1}, ..., h^{k-1}_{u_|N(v)|}])
```

## 2. Conveyance Emergence in Aggregation

### 2.1 Information Concentration Without Softmax

GraphSAGE aggregation creates implicit information concentration patterns measurable as conveyance.

#### Definition: Aggregation-Based Conveyance
```
C_agg(v) = f(concentration, selectivity, preservation)
```

Where:
- concentration: Degree of information focus in aggregation
- selectivity: Sparsity of neighbor contribution
- preservation: Information retention through aggregation

### 2.2 Mean Aggregator Conveyance

#### Mathematical Formulation
```
C_mean(v) = (H_coherence × S_preservation × A_alignment)^{1/3}
```

Where:
```
H_coherence = 1/(1 + σ²_neighbors)
S_preservation = ||μ_neighbors||/σ_neighbors
A_alignment = cos(h_v, μ_neighbors)
```

#### Derivation
Given neighbor set N(v) with embeddings {h_u}:
- Mean: μ = (1/|N(v)|)∑h_u
- Variance: σ² = (1/|N(v)|)∑||h_u - μ||²
- Coherence inversely proportional to variance
- Signal-to-noise ratio determines preservation

### 2.3 Pooling Aggregator Conveyance

#### Mathematical Formulation
```
C_pool(v) = (F_concentration × N_selectivity × I_preservation)^{1/3}
```

Where:
```
F_concentration = max_i(f_i)/mean_i(f_i)
N_selectivity = 1 - |unique_argmax|/|N(v)|
I_preservation = ||pooled||/||mean(neighbors)||
```

#### Derivation
Given transformed features f_i = σ(W_pool h_u_i + b):
- Max pooling selects highest activation per dimension
- Concentration ratio measures dominance of maximum
- Selectivity measures sparsity of contribution
- Preservation measures information retention

### 2.4 LSTM Aggregator Conveyance

#### Mathematical Formulation
```
C_lstm(v) = (H_concentration × M_utilization × P_invariance)^{1/3}
```

Where:
```
H_concentration = 1 - H(h_final)/log(d)
M_utilization = ||c_final > τ||₀/d
P_invariance = 1 - Var_π(LSTM(π(neighbors)))
```

#### Derivation
Given LSTM final states (h_final, c_final):
- Entropy of hidden state: H(h) = -∑p_i log(p_i)
- Cell state utilization: fraction above threshold τ
- Permutation invariance: variance across orderings

## 3. Conveyance Integration with Graph Structure

### 3.1 WHERE Metric Reformulation

```
WHERE_GraphSAGE = γ_connectivity × γ_locality × γ_conveyance
```

Where:
```
γ_connectivity = |E|/|E_max|
γ_locality = 1/(1 + d̄)
γ_conveyance = (1/|V|)∑_{v∈V} C_agg(v)
```

### 3.2 Multi-Layer Conveyance Evolution

For layers k = 1...K:
```
ΔC_k = C(h^k) - C(h^{k-1})
```

Information flow efficiency:
```
η_k = ΔC_k/||h^k - h^{k-1}||
```

## 4. Equivalence to Attention-Based Conveyance

### 4.1 Theorem: Conveyance Substrate Independence

**Statement**: Aggregation-based conveyance (GraphSAGE) and attention-based conveyance (GEARS) measure equivalent information concentration properties.

**Proof Sketch**:

Given attention weights α and aggregation function AGG:

1. Attention conveyance: C_att = 1 - H(α)/log(n)
2. Aggregation implicitly defines weights w_agg
3. For mean: w_agg = 1/n (uniform)
4. For pooling: w_agg = sparse indicator
5. Both measure concentration: C ∝ 1/entropy

### 4.2 Empirical Validation

```python
def validate_conveyance_equivalence(graph):
    # Compute GEARS conveyance
    attention_weights = compute_attention(graph)
    C_gears = 1 - entropy(attention_weights)/log(len(neighbors))
    
    # Compute GraphSAGE conveyance
    aggregated = aggregate_neighbors(graph)
    C_graphsage = compute_aggregation_conveyance(aggregated)
    
    # Correlation coefficient
    ρ = correlation(C_gears, C_graphsage)
    assert ρ > 0.8
```

## 5. Computational Complexity

### 5.1 Conveyance Computation Costs

| Aggregator | Aggregation | Conveyance | Total |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Mean | O(|N(v)|d) | O(|N(v)|d) | O(|N(v)|d) |
| Pooling | O(|N(v)|d²) | O(|N(v)|d) | O(|N(v)|d²) |
| LSTM | O(|N(v)|d²) | O(P|N(v)|d²) | O(P|N(v)|d²) |

Where P = number of permutations for invariance testing

### 5.2 Incremental Update Complexity

GraphSAGE enables local conveyance updates:
```
C_new(v) = update_local(C_old(v), Δneighbors)
```

Complexity: O(|Δneighbors|d) vs O(|V|²d) for global recomputation

## 6. Implementation Specification

### 6.1 Conveyance Measurement Pipeline

```python
class GraphSAGEConveyance:
    def __init__(self, aggregator_type):
        self.aggregator = self._select_aggregator(aggregator_type)
    
    def compute_conveyance(self, node_features, neighbor_features):
        if self.aggregator_type == 'mean':
            return self._mean_conveyance(node_features, neighbor_features)
        elif self.aggregator_type == 'pool':
            return self._pool_conveyance(neighbor_features)
        elif self.aggregator_type == 'lstm':
            return self._lstm_conveyance(neighbor_features)
    
    def _mean_conveyance(self, node, neighbors):
        mean_neighbor = neighbors.mean(dim=0)
        variance = neighbors.var(dim=0).mean()
        coherence = 1.0 / (1.0 + variance)
        snr = mean_neighbor.norm() / (neighbors.std(dim=0).norm() + 1e-8)
        alignment = F.cosine_similarity(node, mean_neighbor, dim=0)
        return (coherence * torch.tanh(snr) * alignment) ** (1/3)
    
    def _pool_conveyance(self, neighbors):
        transformed = F.relu(self.W_pool @ neighbors.T + self.b)
        max_vals, max_indices = torch.max(transformed, dim=1)
        mean_vals = transformed.mean(dim=1)
        concentration = (max_vals / (mean_vals + 1e-8)).mean()
        unique_contributors = torch.unique(max_indices).numel()
        selectivity = 1.0 - (unique_contributors / len(neighbors))
        preservation = max_vals.norm() / neighbors.mean(dim=0).norm()
        return (concentration * selectivity * preservation) ** (1/3)
```

### 6.2 Validation Against GEARS

```python
def cross_architecture_validation(test_graph):
    # GEARS implementation
    gears_model = build_gears_model(test_graph)
    attention_weights = gears_model.get_attention_weights()
    gears_conveyance = compute_attention_conveyance(attention_weights)
    
    # GraphSAGE implementation
    graphsage_model = build_graphsage_model(test_graph)
    graphsage_conveyance = GraphSAGEConveyance('pool')
    sage_scores = []
    for node in test_graph.nodes:
        neighbors = graphsage_model.sample_neighbors(node)
        score = graphsage_conveyance.compute_conveyance(
            node.features, neighbors.features
        )
        sage_scores.append(score)
    
    # Statistical validation
    correlation = np.corrcoef(gears_conveyance, sage_scores)[0, 1]
    return correlation > 0.8
```
