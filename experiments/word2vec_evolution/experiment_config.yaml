# Word2Vec Evolution Experiment Configuration
# Testing theory-practice bridges across word2vec → doc2vec → code2vec

experiment:
  name: "Word2Vec Evolution Analysis"
  description: |
    Analyze the evolution of embedding techniques from word2vec to
    doc2vec to code2vec by examining theory-practice bridges between
    papers and their implementation repositories. Test hypotheses about
    entropy patterns at bridge points and temporal evolution.

hypotheses:
  h1:
    name: "Theory-Practice Bridge Detection"
    description: |
      Papers and their implementation code will show low entropy (high clarity)
      at specific bridge points where theoretical concepts map directly to
      implementation patterns.
    validation: |
      Measure entropy at points of high semantic similarity between paper
      and code. Expect entropy < 0.3 at true bridge points.

  h2:
    name: "Temporal Evolution Pattern"
    description: |
      Core concepts from word2vec will propagate through doc2vec to code2vec,
      showing consistent low-entropy bridges across the timeline.
    validation: |
      Track specific concepts (e.g., "skip-gram", "negative sampling") across
      all three paper-code pairs. Measure semantic drift and entropy changes.

  h3:
    name: "Citation Network Alignment"
    description: |
      Papers that cite previous work will show stronger semantic overlap
      and preserve low-entropy bridge patterns from cited work.
    validation: |
      Compare citation relationships with semantic similarity scores and
      entropy pattern preservation.

pipeline:
  stages:
    1_import:
      - Download papers from ArXiv
      - Clone GitHub repositories
      - Extract text content from both sources

    2_embed:
      - Generate embeddings for paper sections
      - Generate embeddings for code modules
      - Store in ArangoDB with metadata

    3_analyze:
      - Calculate entropy maps for each document
      - Identify low/high entropy regions
      - Detect bridge points between paper-code pairs

    4_compare:
      - Overlay semantic maps for each pair
      - Identify common bridge patterns
      - Track concept evolution across timeline

    5_validate:
      - Extract citation network
      - Compare with detected patterns
      - Generate validation metrics

outputs:
  - entropy_maps/       # Visualization of entropy patterns
  - bridge_points/      # Detected theory-practice bridges
  - evolution_graph/    # Temporal evolution visualization
  - validation_report/  # Metrics and hypothesis testing results
