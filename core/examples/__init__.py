"""
Core Framework Usage Examples
=============================

Theory Connection - Information Reconstructionism:
These examples demonstrate practical application of the Conveyance Framework
C = (W·R·H/T)·Ctx^α through the core infrastructure modules. Each example
shows how to optimize different dimensions while maintaining Context coherence
and enabling exponential amplification through proper measurement and configuration.

From Actor-Network Theory: Examples serve as "inscriptions" that translate
theoretical concepts into practical implementations, enabling developers to
maintain coherent understanding of framework application across different
use cases and system components.
